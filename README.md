### Main features:
* The system is controlled/monitored using the MQTT protocol
* It supports three different soil moisture levels selected by the user
  * Soil moisture is detected using a "soil moisture sensor" 
  * Soil moisture is automatically controlled using a water pump to irrigate
* It supports three different light levels selected by the user
  * Light intensity is detected using a photoresistor 
  * Light intensity is automatically controlled using "grow full spectrum LEDs"
* The water level in the tank is monitored by a "soil moisture sensor" used as water-level sensor
